    <h2>Dream Travel List</h2>
    <p>Welcome! This is a list of some of the places i'd really like to travel to someday, in no particular order.</p>
    </div>
    <main>
        <div id ="container">
            <h3> Leshan Giant Buddha </h3>
            <p>  
                <img id ="imgLeshan" src ="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Leshan_Buddha_Statue_View.JPG" alt = "Leshan, China Giant Buddha">
                Behold, <b>giant Buddha.</b> Saw this on Disney's Abominable and immediately added this place to my list.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id ="container">
            <h3> Seoul, South Korea</h3>
            <p>
                <img id ="imgSeoul" src ="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2246/7407/articles/kfoodtable-e1552928746975_1600x.png?v=1560793954" alt = "Korean Food">
                Korea in itself is beautiful, but I really just love the food. I'm also half korean 
                so it'd be a chance for me to connect more with the culture. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id ="container">
            <h3> Egypt </h3>
            <p>
                <img id ="imgEgypt" src ="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-XtFVj7B/0/X3/i-XtFVj7B-X3.jpg" alt = "Small Temple at Abu Simbel">
                Ancient Egyptians contributed so much to modern society - calendars, language, math, medicine, etc. It'd be really humbling to be able to 
                experience those ancient temples and walk through those same ruins that they did.  
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id ="container">
            <h3> Peru </h3>
            <p> 
                <img id ="imgPeru" src ="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b56952349419f749667d43f38b4d05e2980821a2/0_176_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=1020&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e547582e6061033555ba7b810c5c429" alt = "Machu Picchu in Peru">
                Honestly just looks beautiful and Peru itself is a beautiful country. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id ="container">
            <h3> Antelope Canyon</h3>
            <p>
                <img id ="imgAntelope" src ="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/12/antelope11.jpg" alt = "Antelope Canyon">
                The whole Grand Canyon is definitely on the list, but it's something about the Antelope Canyon that really draws my attention. 
            </p>
