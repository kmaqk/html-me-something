            <h3 class="title"> Leshan Giant Buddha </h3>
            <p class="text">  
                Behold, <b>giant Buddha.</b> Saw this on Disney's Abominable and immediately added this place to my list.

            <img id ="imgSeoul" src ="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2246/7407/articles/kfoodtable-e1552928746975_1600x.png?v=1560793954" alt = "Korean Food">
            <h3 class="title"> Seoul, South Korea</h3>
            <p class ="text">
                Korea in itself is beautiful, but I really just love the food. I'm also half korean 
                so it'd be a chance for me to connect more with the culture. 
            </p>

        <div class ="container">
            <img id ="imgEgypt" src ="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-XtFVj7B/0/X3/i-XtFVj7B-X3.jpg" alt = "Small Temple at Abu Simbel">
            <h3 class="title"> Egypt </h3>
            <p class="text"> 
                Ancient Egyptians contributed so much to modern society - calendars, language, math, medicine, etc. It'd be really humbling to be able to 
                experience those ancient temples and walk through those same ruins that they did.

            <h3 class="title"> Peru </h3>
            <p class="text"> 
                Honestly just looks beautiful and Peru itself is a beautiful country.

            <h3 class="title"> Antelope Canyon</h3>
            <p class="text">
                The whole Grand Canyon is definitely on the list, but it's something about the Antelope Canyon that really draws my attention.
